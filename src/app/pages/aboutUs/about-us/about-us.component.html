        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Login:</strong> Users must log in using their registered email and password. The system
                validates the inputs and provides feedback for invalid credentials or non-existent users.</li>
            <li><strong>Navigating the System:</strong> After logging in, users can access different sections of the
                system through the navigation menu. Key areas include User Management, Product Management, Unit Testing,
                and About Us.</li>
            <li><strong>User Management:</strong> Users with appropriate permissions can add new users by filling out
                required fields such as first name, last name, email, and password. Existing users can be edited or
                deleted based on their assigned products.</li>
            <li><strong>Product Management:</strong> Users can view a list of all products along with their details. New
                products can be added by selecting categories and brands from dropdown menus. Products can be edited or
                deleted with necessary validations in place to prevent errors (e.g., deleting a product assigned to a
                user).</li>
